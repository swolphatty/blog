this week we learned about packet movement on all levels. from what your computer does to prepare to send and recieve packets to how it gets routed through the internet or other connections.
we learned about peer to peer connections and internet connections and what the differences are
we also learned how to ping and traceroute and whois websites.
I found this weeks teachings kind of hard to follow but at the same time very interesting. I look forward to learning more and more about servers and how the internet works!!
