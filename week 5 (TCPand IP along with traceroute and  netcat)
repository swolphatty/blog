This week we dove into TCP/IP protocols and network tracing.
  we learned how to check a port and an ip address
  Learned how to use netcat and traceroute to do this
  learned about what protocol packets look like and how big/small they can get
  shown visual diagrams that helped understand how each layer added headers and trailers (very helpful)

The try hack me had us use a VM to test out traceroute and netcat (nc) and read through the man pages of both of them
  saw examples of how traceroute shows ports it passes through 
  learned how to read the ports like a map 
  recognized which port was closest to the address we were trying to reach.
  
Thank you for reading what I learned in week 5 of my networking class.
